# Django-Project

In this project I am learning how to use Django in web developing. I am preparing back-end side of e-commerce project
for further JavaScript implementation. JS course is about to start, in meantime I will inject some scripts when I'll get
more familiar with JS effects. For now I was thinking about JS usage for e.g. in products list or detailed view. So far I used
Bootstrap v4 for basic site layout.
### **Changelog**:
  - Product lists/categories connected with database.
  - Unique product urls - done.
  - Search button is working.
  - Site layout is responsive.(navbar and footer)
  - Implementing django-registration-redux (login, registration forms).
